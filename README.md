## Assignment Details

For each of the following cases of NMOS and PMOS, calculate the delay, static power, and dynamic power for a CMOS inverter for the below combinations. Also, find the NML and NMH for each case and explain your observations. 

1. Varying supply voltages of 1.2 V, 0.8 V, and 0.3 V. 

2. Varying device widths of 100 nm, 200 nm, 300 nm, and 400 nm. L= 60 nm

3. Varying device lengths of 60 nm, 90 nm, 120 nm, and 150 nm. W= 400 nm

4. Varying W and L but keep W/L = 2

5. All the LVT, RVT, and HVT devices (W: 400 nm, L: 60 nm).

6. Two cases of inverters with NMOS - LVT: PMOS - HVT, NMOS - HVT: PMOS - LVT (W: 400 nm, L: 60 nm).

7. All the corners TT, SS, FF, SNFP, FNSP (W: 400 nm, L: 60 nm)

8. Varying Temperature -40, 0, 27, 80, 125 (W: 400 nm, L: 60 nm)

   [Marks : 80]

Design an inverter with β = 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 with 5fF load, and show all the VTCs on a single plot. Observe the VTC shift with β.
Find the NML and NMH for all the cases. Explain the results. Also, report the delay, rise time, fall time, static power, and dynamic energy.

[Marks : 35]

Design a five-stage ring oscillator. Report Maximum frequency for the following cases. 
FF(125℃), FF(-40℃), SS(125℃), SS(-40℃)
